# odin-recipes

This is my first project on The Odin Project.
I will create a basic web page with three recipes which will be done using HTML and CSS.

In this project I learned:
-how to use links
-flexbox basics
-grid basics
-box-shadow property
-basic web design
-different CSS properties: padding, margin, universal selector, pseudo-classes, borders
